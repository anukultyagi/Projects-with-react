# Todo List App

This is a basic todo list application built with React. The application allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark todo items as completed.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the application:

1. **Layout**: Begin by creating the layout of the todo list without any functionality. This step helps in understanding the structure of the application.

2. **Mapping List**: Create a mapping list to display the todo items dynamically in the UI. This involves iterating over the list of todos and rendering each item in the list.

3. **Two-Way Binding**: Implement two-way binding in the input element using React state. This allows users to input todo items and see them reflected in the UI.

4. **Functionality**: Add functionality to the application, such as adding new todo items and displaying them dynamically.

5. **Completed Checkbox**: Implement the ability to mark todo items as completed by adding checkboxes.

6. **CSS Styling**: Enhance the visual appearance of the application by adding CSS styling, including styles for completed todo items.

7. **Delete Button**: Add functionality to delete todo items from the list.

8. **Toast Notifications**: Integrate toast notifications to provide feedback to users when actions are performed, such as adding or deleting todo items.

9. **Edit Button**: Implement the ability to edit todo items directly in the list.

10. **Local Storage**: Store todo items in the browser's local storage to persist data between sessions.

By following these steps incrementally, users can gradually build the functionality of the todo list app without feeling overwhelmed by the code complexity.
